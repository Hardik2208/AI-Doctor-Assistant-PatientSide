# üè• Clinics Integration Setup Guide

This guide explains how to integrate the National Hospital Directory API from data.gov.in with your AI Doctor Assistant application.

## üìã Prerequisites

1. **Data.gov.in API Key**: You'll need an API key from the Government of India's Open Data Portal
2. **Node.js**: Make sure you have Node.js installed
3. **Internet Connection**: Required for API calls and location services

## üîë Getting Your API Key

### Step 1: Visit data.gov.in
1. Go to [https://data.gov.in/](https://data.gov.in/)
2. Click on "LOGIN | REGISTER" in the top right corner
3. Create an account or login with existing credentials

### Step 2: Get API Access
1. After logging in, navigate to your profile/dashboard
2. Look for "API Key" or "API Access" section
3. Generate a new API key for the National Hospital Directory dataset
4. Copy the API key (you'll need it for the next step)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Step 1: Environment Variables
1. Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Open the `.env` file and replace the placeholder with your actual API key:
   ```env
   VITE_DATA_GOV_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
   ```

### Step 2: Verify Installation
1. Make sure all dependencies are installed:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

3. Navigate to `http://localhost:5173/clinics` to test the integration

## üó∫Ô∏è How It Works

### Location Detection
- The app automatically detects the user's current location using the browser's geolocation API
- If location access is denied, it defaults to Delhi coordinates
- Hospitals are sorted by distance from the user's location

### API Integration
- Fetches hospital data from the National Hospital Directory API
- Processes and normalizes the data for consistent display
- Includes fallback to mock data if the API is unavailable

### Data Processing
The API provides:
- **Hospital Name**: Official name of the healthcare facility
- **Location**: Address and geographic details
- **Coordinates**: Latitude and longitude for mapping
- **Category**: Type of hospital (Government, Private, etc.)

### Features
- **Distance Calculation**: Shows how far each hospital is from user location
- **Category Filtering**: Filter by hospital type (Government, Private, Trust, etc.)
- **Search Functionality**: Search by hospital name, location, or specialties
- **Sorting Options**: Sort by distance, rating, or name
- **Direct Actions**: Get directions via Google Maps or call directly

## üè• Supported Hospital Categories

The system automatically categorizes hospitals based on their names:

- **Government**: AIIMS, Government hospitals, District hospitals
- **Private**: Corporate hospitals, Private clinics
- **Railway**: Railway hospitals and clinics
- **ESI**: Employee State Insurance hospitals
- **Defence**: Military, Army, Navy, Air Force hospitals
- **Municipal**: Corporation and municipal hospitals
- **Trust**: Charitable and mission hospitals

## üîß Customization

### Adding More Data Fields
To add more fields from the API response, modify the `processHospitalData` function in `/src/services/hospitalApi.js`:

```javascript
return {
  id: index + 1,
  name: hospitalName,
  category: category,
  location: location,
  latitude: latitude,
  longitude: longitude,
  // Add new fields here
  newField: hospital.new_field || hospital.NewField,
  // ...
};
```

### Changing Search Radius
To modify the default search radius (currently 50km), update the call in `/src/pages/Clinics.jsx`:

```javascript
const nearbyHospitals = userLocation 
  ? getHospitalsNearLocation(hospitalData, userLocation, 100) // Change to 100km
  : hospitalData;
```

### Custom Styling
The component uses Tailwind CSS. Modify the className properties in the JSX to customize the appearance.

## üö® Troubleshooting

### API Key Issues
- **Error**: "Invalid API key"
  - **Solution**: Verify your API key is correct and active on data.gov.in
  - **Check**: Make sure the key is properly set in the `.env` file

### Location Issues
- **Error**: "Location access denied"
  - **Solution**: The app falls back to Delhi coordinates automatically
  - **Manual**: Users can search for hospitals in specific cities

### No Hospitals Found
- **Cause**: API might be down or no hospitals in the area
  - **Solution**: App shows fallback mock data
  - **Action**: Check console for API error messages

### CORS Issues
- **Error**: "CORS policy" errors
  - **Solution**: The API should support CORS, but if issues persist, consider using a proxy server

## üì± Mobile Responsiveness

The clinics page is fully responsive and includes:
- Touch-friendly search and filter controls
- Optimized card layout for mobile screens
- Swipe-friendly interface elements
- Call and directions buttons for mobile users

## üîÑ Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
1. **Real-time Availability**: Integration with hospital booking systems
2. **Reviews and Ratings**: User-generated hospital reviews
3. **Insurance Network**: Filter by insurance acceptance
4. **Appointment Booking**: Direct appointment scheduling
5. **Emergency Services**: Real-time emergency room status

## üìû Support

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check the browser console for error messages
2. Verify your API key is active on data.gov.in
3. Ensure location services are enabled in your browser
4. Check your internet connection
